# Movie-Recommendation-System-Description
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 100K dataset. It applies collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based) and matrix factorization (SVD) to suggest top-rated unseen movies, with evaluation via Precision at K for performance measurement.
